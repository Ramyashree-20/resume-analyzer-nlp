**1. üîç AI-Powered Resume Analyzer**
*   **Upload and Parse:** Users can upload their resumes in PDF or DOCX format.
*   **Deep Contextual Analysis:** Instead of simple keyword matching, the app uses OpenAI's GPT models to perform a deep, semantic analysis of the resume against a pasted job description.
*   **Detailed Feedback:** The analysis generates a comprehensive report including:
    *   A **Match Score** with a clear justification.
    *   A list of **Missing Keywords** and skills.

    *   **Actionable Advice** on how to enhance the resume.

**2. üëî Intelligent Job Recommender**
*   **AI-Driven Search:** The app doesn't just search for a list of skills. It uses an AI model to determine the most relevant *job titles* based on the user's resume content.
*   **Real-Time Job Listings:** It integrates with the SerpApi Google Jobs API to fetch current job openings based on the AI-suggested titles.
*   **Direct Apply Links:** Each job listing includes the company, location, a brief description, and a direct link to the application page.

**3. üí¨ Conversational Career Chatbot**
*   **Context-Aware:** The chatbot is pre-loaded with the context of the user's uploaded resume.
*   **Personalized Advice:** Users can ask specific questions about their resume ("How can I improve my project descriptions?") or general career questions ("What are the career paths for a data analyst?").
*   **Interactive and Engaging:** Provides a familiar chat interface for a natural and helpful conversation.
